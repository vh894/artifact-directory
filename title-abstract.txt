Title:
Electric Vehicle Charging Station - Optimizing Placement Tool via Infrastructure Modeling (EVCS-OPTIM)

Abstract:
The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) is critical in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable transportation. However, the expansion of EV infrastructure, particularly charging stations, must be strategic to support increased EV adoption effectively. EVCS-OPTIM aims to help urban planners, utility companies, and charging infrastructure developers find the most optimal parking lots for new EV charging stations within San Diego County. By integrating factors such as proximity to existing infrastructure and consumer-demand incentives, this project aims to provide an interactive tool that facilitates strategic decision-making for EV infrastructure deployment.
